Require an SSL Connection to a PostgreSQL DB Instance? Here are some notes from my investigations.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL
Not great examples on that but take a look at this other documentation for secure connection to Redshift database which has working examples
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-from-psql.html
Go to EC2 Security Groups, and modify the Inbound PostgreSQL rule from the VPS server eg something like “sg-c2a232b8” to either your current IP or to Anywhere eg 0.0.0.0/0
Setting it to Anywhere means both you and your EC2 application can connect to the database, but so can the rest of the world. Setting it to just your current IP means only you and anyone else on that IP (if it is a work or university IP) can connect to the database. Of course, they will need the key, username and password so reasonably secure.
