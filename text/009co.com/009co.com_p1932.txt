Attended the excellent Data Science Festival Mayday event May 20, 2023 in London, UK at CodeNode, Moorgate and Old Street.
The venue was two floors with 4 event rooms, large breakout halls, with 40 speakers and attended by 600 people.
The talks are recorded and available at the Data Science Festival Mayday site.
My main takeaway was being quite impressed seeing first hand the wide range of cutting edge AI, ML, and analytics activity happening in the UK.
